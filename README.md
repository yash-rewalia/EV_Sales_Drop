# Overview
Zoom Electric (ZE) is an electric vehicle venture owned by a renowned automotive manufacturer called ZOOM MOTORS India Private Limited.
As an analyst in the Sales and Operations team at Zoom Electric, your responsibilities include managing pre-orders, facilitating client visits for sales, overseeing website sales, and analyzing website visitor data as well as sales performance.
Zoom Electric offers a range of automotive and scooter products, including FioNex, Sprint, and Parker, along with some exclusive limited-edition variants.
Recently, ZE introduced a new scooter model called Sprint in the electric two-wheeler segment. Initially, the sales numbers for Sprint Scooters were quite impressive during the first two weeks of its launch. However, unexpectedly, there was a sudden decline in sales thereafter.




# Electric Vehicle Sales Drop
The sales performance of Sprint Scooters exhibited an impressive start during the first
two weeks of its launch. However, unexpectedly, there was a sudden decrease in sales
by 20%.


# Implication
Email Marketing Campaign is not upto the upmark.


# Objectives
1. Validate this sales drop by examining the cumulative sales volume over a rolling 7-
day period. This approach allows for a consistent evaluation of sales performance
throughout the week.

2. Examine the calculated sales growth percentage to determine if it is negative or
shows a decline. This confirms that sales have indeed decreased.

3. Collect email campaign-related data specifically for Sprint scooters.
   
4. Include data from the period of 2 months before the sprint model launch, as the
digital marketing campaign started only 2 months before the launch. 

5. Connect the two data sets considering that a single customer may have received
multiple emails for different products during the campaign.

6.  To calculate the Click Rate, Refer to the following formula: Click Rate = ( E-mails
Clicked ) / (E-mail sent - Bounced).
